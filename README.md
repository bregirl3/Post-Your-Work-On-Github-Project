Programming for Data Science with Python

Overview

In this project, Python is used to explore data extracted from bikeshare systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Requirements include:

Importing data and addressing interesting questions regarding the output results by computing descriptive statistics.
Creating a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
Operation
The developed CLI program allows the user to explore a US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to choose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.

Project Instructions

Create a GitHub profile if you have not already done so. You can visit https://github.com/ to do this.
Download the document template: Git Commands Documentation. Make a copy of this document on your Google drive. This is the only file you'll need to submit for this project. More details on how to use this template are provided below.
Download Atom or another text editor that allows you to preview markdown files. If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, more details on this are provided in the Tasks: Documentation page.
See the next few pages for detailed instructions on the tasks you need to set up and edit your repository. Remember, as you complete these tasks, you should be copying and pasting the git commands you use into the submission template.
Submission Template: Git Commands Documentation
There are five sections in this document template. Each section includes a table with the instructions for you to complete in your local and remote repository and space to copy and paste the git commands. Once you complete each task, you will be required to include or copy and paste the git command in that corresponding table row.

Once you have completed entering the required responses within the tables in all four sections in this document, download this document as a PDF file. Please submit the PDF file of the Git Commands Documentation on the Project Submission page within the Udacity Classroom. There is also a place to add the url for your public GitHub repository in the first box. Add this link to the PDF, as your project will also be reviewed.
